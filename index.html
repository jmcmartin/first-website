<h1>Colorado</h1>
<h2>Josh McMartin</h2>
<p>Colorado is home to many different regions like the Rocky Mountains to the plains.</p>
<p>I enjoy to ride my red and silver bicycle. My friends and I like to ride together to different places and get lunch on break.</p>
<p>I also like to play video games. I prefer Xbox and Nintendo over Playstation.</p>
I have a yellow lab named Beau. He is about 5 and a half years old. He is very nice and doesn't bark like some dogs. My sister and I take care of him by walking him, giving him food, and playing with him.
<p>These are three of my favorite foods:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Filet Mignon</h3>
